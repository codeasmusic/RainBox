=======

This is a skydrive project, which uses HDFS, Hbase and J2EE frameworks.

1.Because the speed of the network is so slow that the jars in the /WEB-INF/lib are not committed. 

  You can find the name of these jars in the /.classpath.

2.Please unzip the ffmpeg.rar in the /WEB-INF/flv, which is used to play the videos in the skydrive.
